Scripts and Notebooks for experimentation.

- **[develop](./develop)** (Python): Experimental code to try out new ideas and experiments. Use Jupyter notebooks wherever you can. Naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_userid_short-description`. If you cannot use a notebook and have multiple scripts/files for an experiment, create a folder with the same naming convention. Each file should be handled by one person only.
  
- **[deliver](./deliver)** (Python): Refactored notebooks that contain valuable insights or results (e.g. visualizations, training runs). Notebooks should be refactored, documented, contain outputs, and use the following naming schema: `YYYY-MM-DD_short-description`. Notebooks in deliver should not be changed or rerun. If you want to rerun a deliver Notebook, please duplicate it into the develop folder.

- **[templates](./templates)** (Python): Refactored Notebooks that are reusable for a specific task (e.g. model training, data exploration). Notebooks should be refactored, documented, not contain any output, and use the following naming schema: `short-description`. If you like to make use of a template Notebook, duplicate the notebook into develop folder.
